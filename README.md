## Mu3e Experiment

The [Mu3e experiment](https://www.psi.ch/de/mu3e) at PSI pursues one of the most sensitive tests of charged lepton flavour violation: the decay $\mu^{+} \rightarrow e^{+} e^{-} e^{+}$. Within the Standard Model this channel is suppressed to branching ratios below $10^{-54}$, so any observation would point directly to new physics such as heavy neutral leptons, supersymmetric particles, or multi-TeV gauge bosons. Mu3e therefore aims for single-event sensitivities down to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-16})$ in Phase I and below $\mathcal{O}(10^{-17})$ in the Phase II upgrade.

The collaboration also records so-called candle modes that are predicted by the Standard Model and serve as in-situ calibrations. The internal-conversion decay $\mu^{+} \rightarrow e^{+} e^{-} e^{+} \nu_{e} \bar{\nu}_{\mu}$ (“$\mu \rightarrow 3e2\nu$”) and the rarer five-lepton channel $\mu^{+} \rightarrow e^{+} e^{-} e^{+} e^{-} e^{+} \nu_{e} \bar{\nu}_{\mu}$ (“$\mu \rightarrow 5e2\nu$”) provide precise control samples to validate momentum reconstruction, timing alignment, and background modelling.

Achieving the design sensitivity requires an ultra-light detector composed of HV-MAPS MuPix pixels, scintillating fibre and tile timing layers, and a 1 T solenoidal field that transports up to $10^{8}$ muons per second in Phase I. The planned Phase II upgrade pushes the instantaneous rate to $10^{9}$ muons per second using the High-Intensity Muon Beam (HiMB) line, demanding sub-0.1% radiation-length services, micro-channel cooling, radiation-hard mechanics, and a triggerless DAQ capable of digesting multi-terabit-per-second data streams. The IP cores in this repository underpin the FPGA building blocks that make that readout strategy feasible.

## About the Project

The Mu3e detector relies on fully monolithic HV-MAPS MuPix sensors with $\mathbf{80 \times 80\ \mu m^{2}}$ pixels, providing per-hit timestamps of $\sigma\approx 20\ \mathrm{ns}$ with $\mathbf{50\ \mu m}$ thickness and serialising zero-suppressed data at up to $\mathbf{1.25\ \mathrm{Gbit/s}}$ per link. Timing layers combine $\sim 250\ \mu\mathrm{m}$ scintillating fibres read by SiPM arrays and fast plastic scintillator tiles to reach $\mathbf{< 100\ \mathrm{ps}}$ time-of-flight resolution. All sub-detectors feed custom Front-End Boards that fan out more than $\mathbf{400}$ 1.25 Gbps low-voltage differential links (LVDS) into optical FireFly transceivers and route traffic to Detector Adapter Boards (DABs) populated with Intel Arria 5 and Arria 10 FPGAs. A full detector slice already moves in excess of $\mathbf{1.5\ \mathrm{Tbit/s}}$ during Phase I operation, with Phase II designs targeting several multi-terabit fabrics to handle the HiMB rate.

The firmware stack orchestrated by this repository spans the complete readout chain: packet schedulers for G/D/1 deterministic multiplexing, MuTRiG slow-control SPI and configuration hardware core, timestamp processors that unify the MuTRiG counting scheme (625 MHz) into the Mu3e counting scheme (125 MHz), histogramming for online monitoring, and Altera Network-on-Chip (NoC) that stitch the system together. Reference Platform Designer TCL scripts and hardware abstraction packages ensure each IP can be regenerated reproducibly, while synthesizable testbenches and Python drivers enable continuous regression testing in ModelSim/Questa environments. The codebase currently comprises roughly $\mathbf{272k}$ lines of HDL, TCL, and support scripts spread across the IP submodules.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Quartus Prime 18.1** or later (18.1 recommended)
- **Python 3.10+** (for testbenches)
- **ModelSim / Questa** for simulation
- **Tcl 8.5+** for integration scripts

### Installation

1. Clone this repository and its submodules:
   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/yifeng-ethz/mu3e-ip-cores.git
   ```
2. Add the desired IP cores to your Quartus project.
3. For each core, run the provided Platform Designer script (the `*_hw.tcl` file) to generate the IP.
4. Use the provided VHDL or system-level wrappers as integration examples.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

---

## Usage

Detailed integration instructions are provided in each core’s subdirectory.  In general:

1. Open Platform Designer (formerly Qsys) in Quartus.
2. Select **IP search path** to source the corresponding `*_hw.tcl` script to instantiate the IP.
3. Configure parameters (e.g., burst widths, channel counts) as required for your design.
4. Export generated system top RTL file and connect the IP into your top‑level design or testbench.

For simulation, the subdirectories include VHDL testbenches and Python scripts demonstrating correct operation.
