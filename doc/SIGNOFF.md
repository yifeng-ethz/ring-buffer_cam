## Health

| status | field | value |

| ℹ️ | harness_output_constraints | `32 probe_out observation outputs remain harness-only unconstrained paths; internal clk125 reg-to-reg timing is constrained and closed` |

## Synthesis

| status | item | value |
|:---:|---|---|
| ✅ | revision | `ring_buffer_cam_syn_p4` |
| ✅ | implementation | delivered VHDL P4 standalone project (`rtl/vhd_ver/` + `rtl/common/`) |
| ✅ | device | `5AGXBA7D4F31C5` |
| ✅ | nominal target | `125 MHz` |
| ✅ | signoff constraint | `137.5 MHz` / `7.273 ns` (`1.1 x 125 MHz`) |
| ✅ | slow 85C WNS / TNS | `+0.515 ns` / `0.000 ns` |
| ✅ | slow 0C WNS / TNS | `+0.575 ns` / `0.000 ns` |
| ✅ | worst hold slack | `+0.171 ns` |
| ✅ | slow 85C Fmax | `147.97 MHz` |
| ✅ | fitted resources | `2,191 ALMs`, `2,861 regs`, `19 RAM blocks`, `153,600` bits |
| ✅ | ALM estimate gate | `2,191 / 4,000 = 54.8%`, max allowed `6,000` |
| ✅ | netlist export | regenerated `syn/quartus/gate_sim/ring_buffer_cam_syn_p4.vo` |
| ℹ️ | TimeQuest caveat | internal `clk125` timing closes; unconstrained paths are standalone harness `probe_out[31:0]` only |

## SystemVerilog Synthesis

| status | item | value |
|:---:|---|---|
| ❌ | revision | `ring_buffer_cam_syn_sv_p4` |
| ℹ️ | implementation | SV migration implementation (`rtl/sv_ver/`) |
| ✅ | compile/fitter | full Quartus compile successful, `0` errors |
| ❌ | signoff timing | slow-85C setup WNS `-14.213 ns`, slow-0C setup WNS `-12.813 ns` |
| ❌ | Fmax | `46.54 MHz` slow-85C, below `137.5 MHz` signoff |
| ✅ | resource ceiling | `4,045 ALMs`, below `6,000` max with 50% bloat |
| ℹ️ | root cause | SV core is a flat behavioral array/loop CAM model, not the VHDL partitioned CAM/encoder timing architecture |

## Non-Claims

- No full IP signoff tag should be cut from this checkpoint: SV timing, DV, and formal are still open.
- The standalone Quartus signoff above is for the VHDL P4 implementation. The SystemVerilog implementation has UVM/static evidence and a separate Quartus revision, but that revision fails timing.
- The branch dead-bin exclusion and 30 s soak requirements are owned by `tb/DV_REPORT.md`; this dashboard does not override them.
- FEB firmware loading, on-chip histogram measurement, SignalTap/STP debug, and `tb_int` hardware comparison were explicitly deferred and are not part of this checkpoint.
